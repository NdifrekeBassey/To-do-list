# To-Do List Application

This is a simple and interactive to-do list application. It allows users to add, mark, delete, and reorder tasks based on their priority. All tasks are saved locally in the browser's `localStorage` to persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed (strike-through).
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Reorder tasks by moving important ones to the top.
- All data is stored in `localStorage` so it persists after page reload.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start adding tasks by typing into the input box and hitting `Enter`.
4. Use the icons to:
   - Mark a task as complete (green check).
   - Delete a task (red trash).
   - Move a task up the list (blue arrow).
